Description: R package to run CLASSIPHY, a simulation-based method to classifying loci based on the biological processes that known to produce gene tree and species tree discord. Specifically, this method uses multiple summary statistics in a machine-learning framework to distinguish sets of trees that were produced by ILS versus HGT.
